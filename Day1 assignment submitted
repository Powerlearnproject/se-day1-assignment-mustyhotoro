Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It is important in the technology industry because it ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and meets the requirements of its users.

2. Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
    - The development of the first programming languages (e.g., COBOL, FORTRAN)
    - The introduction of the Waterfall methodology
    - The emergence of Agile methodologies

3. The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle are:
    - Requirements gathering
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - Testing
    - Deployment
    - Maintenance

4. Waterfall and Agile are two popular software development methodologies. Waterfall is a linear approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. Agile is an iterative approach, where phases are completed in short cycles, with continuous testing and feedback.

5. Scenarios where Waterfall would be appropriate:
    - Safety-critical systems (e.g., aircraft control systems)
    - Systems with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., financial systems)
    - Small projects with well-defined requirements

Scenarios where Agile would be appropriate:
* Projects with rapidly changing requirements
* Projects with high uncertainty or risk
* Projects that require continuous testing and feedback

1. Roles and responsibilities:
    - Software Developer: designs, develops, and tests software
    - Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software meets requirements and is of high quality
    - Project Manager: oversees the project, ensures timely completion, and manages resources

2. Importance of IDEs and VCS:
    - IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) provide a comprehensive development environment, with tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
    - VCS (Version Control Systems) help manage changes to code, collaborate with team members, and maintain version history.

Examples:
* IDEs: Eclipse, Visual Studio
* VCS: Git, SVN

1. Common challenges faced by software engineers:
    - Managing complexity
    - Meeting deadlines
    - Ensuring software quality

Strategies to overcome these challenges:
* Break down complex systems into smaller components
* Use Agile methodologies to manage deadlines and requirements
* Implement continuous testing and feedback

1. Types of testing:
    - Unit testing: tests individual components
    - Integration testing: tests how components interact
    - System testing: tests the entire system
    - Acceptance testing: tests whether the system meets requirements

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing text prompts to interact effectively with AI models.

2. Example of a vague prompt: "Write a story."
Improved prompt: "Write a science fiction story about a character who discovers a hidden planet, with a focus on themes of exploration and self-discovery.

3. The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear guidance on the genre, plot, and themes, allowing the AI model to generate a more relevant and engaging story.
